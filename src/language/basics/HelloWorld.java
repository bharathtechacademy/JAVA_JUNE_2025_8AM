	/*
	 * 1.Debugging and Error Detection Print statements help easily verify variable
	 * values and program flow without requiring complex debugging tools.
	 * 
	 * 2.Monitoring Program ExecutionProvides real-time feedback by allowing
	 * developers to monitor program execution step-by-step during runtime.
	 * 
	 * 3.Education and Learning Simplifies learning for beginners by showing
	 * immediate results, making it easier to understand program behavior.
	 * 
	 * 4.Testing and ValidationHelps check program output and ensure expected
	 * behavior during development.
	 * 
	 * 5.Logging System Prototypes Print statements can act as placeholders for
	 * logging mechanisms during the early stages of development before implementing
	 * a full-fledged logging system.
