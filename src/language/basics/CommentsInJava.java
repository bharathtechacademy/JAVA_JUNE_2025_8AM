	 * This is the main method that serves as the entry point for any Java
	 * application. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts program execution from the
	 * main method. Without the main method, the program cannot be executed (the JVM
	 * needs the main method to begin execution).

	 * @version 0.4
	 * 
	 * @param args The main method accepts a single parameter, an array of strings
	 *             (String[] args). This is used to pass command-line arguments to
	 *             the Java program. Although this method doesnâ€™t use the
	 *             parameter in this specific example, it can be used for passing
	 *             dynamic data into the program at runtime.
	 * 
	 * @return This method does not return anything. The main method is void and
	 *         serves as the starting point for program execution.
	 * 
	 * @throws Exception This method does not throw any exceptions by default.
	 *                   However, in cases where the program uses file operations,
	 *                   networking, or other I/O tasks, exceptions might be thrown.
	 * 
	 * 
	 *                   Example: To run a simple Java program, you can execute it
	 *                   from the command line or an IDE, and the program will begin
	 *                   executing from the main method.
	 * 
	 *                   In this example: The statement inside the main method
	 *                   prints "Hello, World!" to the console and then moves the
	 *                   cursor to the next line.
