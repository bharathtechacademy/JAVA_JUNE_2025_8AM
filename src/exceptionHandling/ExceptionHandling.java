	// Exception: An issue occurred because of logical error and we can control the same using different techniques.
	
	// ExceptionHandling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, allowing the program to continue its execution.
	
	// Exception Handling Techniques:
	
	// 1.throws declaration ==> when we are sure about the exception 
	// 2.try-catch exception handling ==> when we are not sure about the exception 
	// 3.throw an custom exception ==> when there is no exception, create one
